# Semantic-Analysis-of-unstructured-data


Purpose:
To create a web-based search application that allows users to search for Myntra fashion products by querying their descriptions and other attributes.

Technology Stack:

Backend:
Elasticsearch: A search engine used to store, index, and search product data.
SentenceTransformers: A Python library for encoding search queries into vectors using pre-trained models.
Frontend:
Streamlit: A Python library for building interactive web applications.
Core Components:

Elasticsearch Setup:

Connection: The application connects to an Elasticsearch instance using basic authentication and a CA certificate.
Indexing: An index named all_products is created to store product information.
Index Mapping: Defines the structure of the product data, including fields for product ID, name, brand, gender, price, number of images, description, primary color, and a dense vector for the description.
Search Functionality:

Encoding Search Queries: Uses the all-mpnet-base-v2 model from SentenceTransformers to encode user search queries into vectors.
k-NN Search: Performs a k-nearest neighbors search on the DescriptionVector field in Elasticsearch to find the most relevant products based on the encoded search query.
Result Display: Returns and displays the product name and description for the top matching products.
Streamlit Web Interface:

User Input: Users can enter search queries into a text input field.
Search Button: Triggers the search function when clicked.
Results Display: Displays the search results, including product names and descriptions, in a user-friendly format.
